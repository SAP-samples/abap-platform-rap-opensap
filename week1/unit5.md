To onboard to the trial ABAP environment, check out the prerequisites and follow the instructions described in the tutorial:  
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-trial-onboarding.html    

The tutorial also describes how to create an ABAP cloud project in ADT to connect to your SAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment Trial account.  

> **Please note**   
> A faster onboarding process (using _Boosters_) is described in the tutorial. The _Boosters_-based process is different and faster than the one shown in the course video.

## Step 3. [Optional] Download the Service Key in the SAP Cloud Platform Trial Cockpit
In case you have already onboarded to the SAP Cloud Platform ABAP environment trial (_Step 2_) and would like to access your _Service Key_ in the SAP Cloud Platform trial cockpit, please follow the instructions provided below.
